# Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Solutions

## Description
In this project, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to analyze demographic datasets of a general population as well as customers of a German mail order company. 

The aim of the project:

- Clustering the datasets into groups to identify characteristics of existing customers and differences from the general population
- Development of a forecasting model to predict and identify potential customer reactions for a marketing campaign

The data is provided by Arvato Financial Services, a subsidiary of Bertelsmann.

The full project report can be found in this [blog post](https://medium.com/@nadine.puetzer1/customer-segmentation-for-arvato-financial-services-754f436a3adf "blog post").

## How to Install and Run the Project
This is one of Udacity's capstone project for the Data Science Nanodegree program. The population and customer datasets used are only provided as part of the project and are not allowed to be shared due to data privacy. In addition, two further data sets are shared, which serve to explain the individual columns and define the individual data types and values including values describing unknowns.

The code was written in Jupyter Notebook with a Python 3 installation. All required Python libraries are included in the requirements.txt.

## Data Files
- 'Arvato project Workbook.ipynb' : Jupyter Notebook including python code
- 'requirements.txt' : Text file with all required libraries
- 'DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx' and 'DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx' : Two excel files including columns and value descriptions
